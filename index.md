## Welcome.

My name is Francisco Maia Costa, I'm 24 years old and I am a Finance undergraduate at Universidade de Aveiro, with a strong academic foundation and practical experience in corporate banking, investment analysis, and financial operations. My background combines financial rigor with a detail-oriented and solution-driven mindset, strengthened by prior training in product design and process optimization. Iâ€™ve developed analytical tools to support credit decision-making, participated in strategic client meetings, and contributed to the streamlining of internal operations with measurable results. With a solid grasp of financial markets and a growing interest in portfolio strategy and long-term value creation, I am particularly drawn to the asset management industry. At the same time, I remain open to diverse opportunities across finance, where I can apply my analytical strengths, creativity, and business acumen to solve complex problems and support impactful decisions.
